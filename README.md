# Embedded-SW-DFT-IDFT-design
## This project aims to test software implementation of DFT & IDFT on STM microcontroller
### Project Phases:
#### First: Generating the signals with desired frequencies by Matlab then importing them in the project and plotting them on Arduino serial plotter via UART.
#### Second: Implementation of DFT algorithm and applying it on the inputs then plotting them same as the previous way.
#### Third: Implementation of IDFT algorithm and applying it on the output of DFT then plotting output of IDFT same as the previous ways.
#### Drivers used: FPU and USART.
### An example of signal have 1KHz & 15KHz freq. components
